// Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework in 2-3 sentences.

C# is high level programming language developed by Microsoft. C# is simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, rich and supports various computing devices. C# was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and it is just one of the programming languages, supported by the .NET framework. 

.NET includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework. 

Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework so it is understandable that the two concepts would be confused.
